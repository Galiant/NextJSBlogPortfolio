## Requirements

- Have the requirements been met? - Matching Designs, Acceptance Criteria is met

## Maintainability

- Is the code following standards and design patters defined by developers on the project
- Is the code easy to understand (read)? Could a person with little or no prior experience with the code base understand it?
- Is the class/method/variable name clear and understandable
- Which parts of the code are confusing? Why?
- Is the data flow easily understood?
- Is there any code commented out or does it have unnecessary logs? Why?
- Is the code located in the correct file/folder/package?
- Is the code not repeated (DRY Principle)?
- Does this change breaks backward compatibility?

## Testing

- The code is testable
- Are there a sufficient number of automated tests? (At least need to be done unit test, we need to think do we need integration or e2e test)
- The code is Regression Tested. Any part of the platform which will be affected by the code is tested.
- Edge cases are tested
- If you fix bug write test for it

## Performance

- Is there any way to improve the code’s performance?
- Could any of the code be replaced with built-in functions?

## Design

- Does the code follow design standards and practices? Why not?

## Security

- Have you added any new libraries or external dependencies to the codebase? Have these been authorised by developers?
- You are not storing any secrets or sensitive code material locally within any commits you’re pushing
- You are not exposing any sensitive data with logging
- You are not returning errors to the front-end that give hints as to why the application is erroring

## Best Practices

- Styled Components are not inherited in order to apply additional styling
- Do not create styled-components with no styling
- Any redundant styling and styled-components are being removed
- Follow Single Responsibility Principle
- Different errors handled and displayed correctly
- Magic values avoided
- Minimal nesting is used
