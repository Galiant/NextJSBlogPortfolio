When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don't want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a **ref**.

Perhaps the best way to describe a ref is as a bridge; a bridge that allows a component to access or modify an element the ref is attached to. Using refs gives us a way to access elements while bypassing state updates and re-renders; this can be useful in some use cases, but should not be used as an alternative to props and state as stated in the official React docs.

Refs are escape hatches for React developers, and we should try to avoid using them if possible.

## When to use refs

Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs - often a browser API that won't impact the appearance of the component. They are used for references in React, to store a reference to particular DOM nodes or React elements, to access React DOM nodes or React elements, to interact with React DOM nodes or React elements, and to change the value of a child component, without using props.

## useRef and createRef

When working with class-based components, we use **createRef()** to create a ref. However, now that React recommends functional components and general practice is to follow the hooks way of doing things, we don't need to use **createRef()**. Instead, we use **useRef()** to create refs in functional components.

The first difference between useRef and createRef is that **createRef** is typically used when creating a ref in a class component while **useRef** is used in function components. Additionally, createRef returns a new ref object each time it is called while useRef returns the same ref object on every render.

Another main difference is that **createRef** doesn't accept an initial value, so the current property of the ref will be initially set to null. On the other hand, **useRef** can accept an initial value and the current property of the ref will be set to that value.

## Adding a ref to your component

### Class component

```js {4} {12} showLineNumbers
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
 constructor(props) {
   super(props)
   this.myRef = React.createRef();
 }
 ...
 render() {
   return (
     <input
        name="email"
        onChange={this.onChange}
        ref={this.myRef}
        type="text"
    />
   )
 }
}
```

### Functional component

You can add a ref to your component by importing the **useRef** Hook from React:

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';
```

Then, use it to declare a ref inside your component:

```js
const myRef = useRef(null);
.
.
.
<input ref={myRef}/>
```

**useRef** returns an object like this:

```js
{
  current: null; // The value you passed to useRef
}
```

## Refs and the DOM

You can point a ref to any value. However, the most common use case for a ref is to access a DOM element. For example, this is handy if you want to focus an input. When you pass a ref to a **ref** attribute in JSX, like `<input ref={myRef}>`, React will put the corresponding DOM element into **myRef.current**.

The **useRef** hook returns an object with a single property called **current**. Initially, **myRef.current** will be 0. When React creates a DOM node for this `<input>`, React will put a reference to this node into **myRef.current**. You can then access this DOM node from your [event handlers](https://react.dev/learn/responding-to-events) and use the built-in [browser APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element) defined on it.

```js {6} showLineNumbers
// You can use any browser APIs, for example:// inputRef.current.focus();
import { useRef } from 'react';
export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

## Accessing another component’s DOM nodes

If you try to put a ref on your own component, by default you will get null. Here is an example demonstrating it where clicking the button does not focus the input.

```js showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react';

function MyInput(props) {
  return <input {...props} />;
}

export default function MyForm() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
}
```

and it will throw an error in the console while the app is rendering:

<Callout type='danger'>
  Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this ref
  will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?
</Callout>

This happens because by default React does not let a component access the DOM nodes of other components.

Instead, components that _want_ to expose their DOM nodes have to opt into that behavior. A component can specify that it “forwards” its ref to one of its children. Here’s how **MyInput** can use the **forwardRef** API:

```js
const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;
});
```

Ref forwarding is a technique to automatically pass a ref to a child component, allowing the parent component to access that child component’s element and read or modify it in some way.

## Differences between refs and state

Perhaps you’re thinking refs seem less “strict” than state - you can mutate them instead of always having to use a state setting function, for instance. But in most cases, you will want to use state. Refs are an “escape hatch” you won’t need often. Here’s how state and refs compare:

| Refs                                                                                  | State                                                                                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| useRef(initialValue) returns `{ current: initialValue }`                              | useState(initialValue) returns the current value of a state variable and a state setter function ( [value, setValue])                                                        |
| Doesn’t trigger re-render when you change it.                                         | Triggers re-render when you change it.                                                                                                                                       |
| Mutable - you can modify and update current’s value outside of the rendering process. | “Immutable” - you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render.                                                                        |
| You shouldn’t read (or write) the current value during rendering.                     | You can read state at any time. However, each render has its own [State as a Snapshot – React](https://react.dev/learn/state-as-a-snapshot)  of state which does not change. |

## Best practices for refs

Following these principles will make your components more predictable:

- **Treat refs as an escape hatch.** Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If a lot of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach.
- **Don’t read or write** `ref.current` during rendering. If some information is needed during rendering, use [state](https://react.dev/learn/state-a-components-memory) instead. Since React doesn’t know when **ref.current** changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like **if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing()** which only sets the ref once during the first render.)

## useImperativeHandle hook

**useImperativeHandle** is a React Hook that lets you customize the handle exposed as a ref.

**useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, dependencies?)**

Call **useImperativeHandle** at the top level of your component to customize the ref handle it exposes:

```js {4} showLineNumbers
import { forwardRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  useImperativeHandle(
    ref,
    () => {
      return {
        // ... your methods ...
      };
    },
    []
  );
});
```

Parameters:

- ref: The ref you received as the second argument from the **forwardRef** render function,
- createHandle: A function that takes no arguments and returns the ref handle you want to expose. That ref handle can have any type. Usually, you will return an object with the methods you want to expose,
- optional dependencies: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the **createHandle** code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body

### Usage

#### Exposing a custom ref handle to the parent component

By default, components don’t expose their DOM nodes to parent components. For example, if you want the parent component to have access to the DOM node, you have to opt in with **forwardRef** . Like this, a ref to the parent component will receive the DOM node. However, you can expose a custom value instead. To customize the exposed handle, call **useImperativeHandle** at the top level of your component.

In case you don’t want to expose the entire DOM node you can use **useImperativeHandle** to expose a handle with only the methods that you want the parent component to call as below:

```js {5} showLineNumbers
import { forwardRef, useRef, useImperativeHandle } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef(function MyInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);
  useImperativeHandle(
    ref,
    () => {
      return {
        focus() {
          inputRef.current.focus();
        },
        scrollIntoView() {
          inputRef.current.scrollIntoView();
        },
      };
    },
    []
  );
  return <input {...props} ref={inputRef} />;
});
```

#### Exposing your own imperative methods

The methods you expose via an imperative handle don’t have to match the DOM methods exactly. For example, this Post component exposes a scrollAndFocusAddComment method via an imperative handle. This lets the parent Page scroll the list of comments and focus the input field when you click the button.

```js {8} showLineNumbers
import { useRef } from 'react';
import Post from './Post.js';

export default function Page() {
  const postRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    postRef.current.scrollAndFocusAddComment();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleClick}>Write a comment</button>
      <Post ref={postRef} />
    </>
  );
}
```
