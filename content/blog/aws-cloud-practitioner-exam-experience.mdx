Amazon Web Services, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis.

My journey started when I saw information that my company partnered with AWS and had an initiative for AWS Cloud practitioner certification which allowed me to use Partner Network where I had full access to AWS Skill builder.

In AWS skill builder I took AWS Partner Technical Accreditation course and also AWS Cloud Practitioner Essential course. Through AWS Cloud Practitioner Accelerator Program I received a voucher for exam which I was thinking that it would be 50% discount but on the end it was full discount so exam itself cost 0€ for me. However, as bunch of people recommended uDemy course [AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner: 6 Full Practice Exam Tests](https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-practice-test/) to practice for exam I purchase it for 12euro on sale. To get some more experience about AWS services I would recommend also to check and play with [AWS console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).

I found AWS skill builder very good with understandable theory and good examples. Above mentioned uDemy course contains 6 practical exams. Each exam in this set is timed, so you will know when you are taking more time than the official test allows, and at the end of the test you’ll receive a personal breakdown of the questions you answered correctly and incorrectly with detailed explanations to improve your knowledge and make you more prepared to pass the actual exam.

I spend all together around 20 hours learning/preparing for the exam with 0 prior experience (just knew some general stuff about AWS). For exam itself, I booked exam center but it seems that now it is only possible to take exam online. To pass the exam you need to have 700 (70%) points from 1000.

Good luck!!!
