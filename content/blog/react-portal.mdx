React Portals is a feature in the React that provides a way to render a React component at a different location in the DOM instead of where it is declared. According to the React documentation, React Portals offer a method to render children into a DOM node that is not part of the parent component’s DOM hierarchy.

To create a portal, call **createPortal**, passing some JSX, and the DOM node where it should be rendered:

```js
createPortal(children, domNode);
```

### Parameters

- **children**: Anything that can be rendered with React, such as a piece of JSX (e.g. `<div />` or `<SomeComponent />`), a Fragment (`<>...</>`), a string or a number, or an array of these.
- **domNode**: Some DOM node, such as those returned by **document.getElementById()**. The node must already exist. Passing a different DOM node during an update will cause the portal content to be recreated.

### returns

- **createPortal** returns a React node that can be included into JSX or returned from a React component.

## Usage

### Rendering to a different part of the DOM

```js {7} showLineNumbers
import { createPortal } from 'react-dom';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ border: '2px solid black' }}>
      <p>This child is placed in the parent div.</p>
      {createPortal(
        <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>,
        document.body
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

```js
<body>
  <div id='root'>
    <div style='border: 2px solid black'>
      <p>This child is placed inside the parent div.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This child is placed in the document body.</p>
</body>
```

### Rendering a modal dialog with a portal

You can use a portal to create a React components such as modal dialog that floats above the rest of the page, even if the component that summons the dialog is inside a container with **overflow: hidden** or other styles that interfere with the dialog.
